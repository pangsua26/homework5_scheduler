## Project Description
The purpose of this activity is to create a daily planner to manage task activities during the work day hours. The HTML will display the title with today's day (M-F) and today's date (MM/DD). The user is able to scroll up and down through the hour day periods and enter data. The hour time blocks are also color coded: light gray for past time period; red for current time period; and green for future time period. Additionally, the user should be able to save the task when refreshed.

## Experience
I found this activity challenging but also found that creating the HTML for this activity (although still a challenge), slightly more easier than the Code Quiz homework for a few reasons:
1. The hour time block are repetive so once you figured out what worked, it was a matter of copying and pasting the remainder.
2. We did not have to continuously hide, prompt, and display items (which I had issues with)
3. I am finding that I am continously frustrated with functions and the ability to save and get the correct data from local storage when I am working on my own so I will continue to focus on these items in TA breakouts and tutor sessions.

Overall, I didn't get as far as I would have liked but I will continue to work through the identified challenges.
