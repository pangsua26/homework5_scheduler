## Project Description
The purpose of this activity is to creat a daily planner to manage task activities during the work day hours. The html will display the title with today's day (M-F) and today's date (MM/DD). The user is able to scroll up and down through the hour day periods and enter data. The hour time blocks are also color coded: light gray for past time period; red for current time period; and green for future time period.
